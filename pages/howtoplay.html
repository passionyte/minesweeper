        Welcome to Minesweeper! In this game, you utilize your mouse to click on tiles in a puzzle and try to locate the mines.
        To reveal the content of a hidden tile, simply left click on them.
        Numbers (from 1 - 8) on the board represent the nearby bombs surrounding the tile.
        These numbers are used to recognize where bombs are, and you can remember many strategies and patterns to streamline your progression.
        If you suspect a tile of being a mine, you can flag it with right click. Flags help to prevent misclicks, and enable other abilities.

    <pre class="text">
        If you have found the nearby mines (via flagging), you can left click a number tile to 'chord'.
        Chording is a key part of efficiency in Minesweeper, and it is a good tool to use to quickly solve puzzles.
        Flags can be considered a waste of a click, especially if unnecessary and can definitely slow you down.
        A good strategy (smart-chording) is to think several clicks ahead, and if your logic is correct, you may open a ton of tiles by chording with just a flag or two.

        Minesweeper requires a lot of strategic thinking and confirmations.
        In Minesweeper, the two main things the game will be challenging on is your ability to recognize patterns and your clicking.
        You must be able to recognize various patterns with the numbers and be able to subtract nearby mines to assist your thinking.
        There may be oddities such as mandatory guessing, which really can be a bummer. It is typically more common on larger boards with more mines.
        Clicking is very important for obvious reasons. You must be quick and precise, if you want to get a 'good' time. 
        On the topic of precisity, missing clicks can lead to unintentional deaths which really stinks.
